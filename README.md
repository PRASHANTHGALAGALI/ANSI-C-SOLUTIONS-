# ANSI-C-SOLUTIONS-
This repository contains the solutions to the C programs, which i solved as an assignment at Global Edge Software company. Since i was writing the codes, i thought anyway let me add it on the git, so anybody can refer to it. And it would also add greatly to my future prospectus.
